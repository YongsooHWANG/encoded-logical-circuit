# FTQC Controller
- This project develops a software package that manages the execution of the quantum circuits of FT protocols, developed by the FT Circuit Synthesizer

## Environment
- Language :  Python3
- OS:  Ubuntu 20.04 

Note: It does not work well on Mac OS now, but will be fixed soon.

## Prerequisites
To run the project successfully, you need to install the following packages included in "requirements.txt" after installation.
