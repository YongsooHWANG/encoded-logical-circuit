# FTQC Controller
- This project develops a software package that manages the execution of the quantum circuits of FT protocols, developed by the FT Circuit Synthesizer

## Environment
- Language :  Python3
- OS:  Ubuntu 20.04 

Note: It does not work well on Mac OS now, but will be fixed soon.

## Prerequisites
To run the project successfully, you need to install the following packages included in "requirements.txt" after installation.
- *simplejson*, *icecream*, *pandas*, *networkx*, *parse*, *progress*, *qubitmapping*, *userproperty*

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note that the packages *qubitmapping* and *userproperty* are developed by Y.Hwang for this project.

## Installation
We encourage installing this project by cloning the source code from GitHub server.
```
